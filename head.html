Common Character Encodings
UTF-8 (Recommended): Supports a wide range of characters, including those from many different languages. It is the most widely used and modern encoding.
ISO-8859-1: An older encoding for Western European languages.
UTF-16: Supports more characters than UTF-8, but less common for web pages.
ASCII: Encodes only basic English characters (not suitable for multilingual text).
